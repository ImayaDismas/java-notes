 ###Use Method with Parameters
 
 >>An augument is any extra parameter data or information required by the function for it to work.
 
 >>import java.util.Scanner is used to enable one to input data in java.
 
 >>nextLine() used when scanning a string or word.
 
 ###Many Methods and Instances
 
 >>Private variable only the methods in the class can use it
 >>Public variable any class can use (access anywhere).
 
 #####setters
 
 >>sets any input given into a variable specified as private at declaration
  
 #####getters
 
 >>returns the value that was stored in the private variable
 
 >>System.ut.printf - use %s to fetch a stored variable.
 
 ###Constructors
 
 >>Allows one to initalize a variable as soon as you create an object.
 >>Costructor name has the same name as the class name.
 
 >>Objects enable one to pass a different set of variables.(same constructor but several objects)
 
 
###Nested If Statements and If else 

>>Provides Java with a way of making one choice or many choices
>>Nested If statement has an embedded if else statement.
 
 
 ###Else If Statement
 
 >>Enables java to have an alternative options apart from the first one
 >>If allows only one option
 
 ###Conditional Operator
 
 >>is another way of implementing an else if statement
 >>Compact and small
 >> eg age>50? "You are young" : "You are old."
 
 ###Simple Avearging Program
 
 >>Input 10n numbers and calculate the average.
 >>use while loop to scan the 10 numbers.
 
 ###for loops
 
 >>takes three statement/ keyword *where to start, end and an increment by?*
 >> for instance if the end is 10, the loop will execute 11 times
 
 ###Compound Interest
 
 >>A=P(1+r)^n
 >>Use a for loop to loop through the years.
 
 ###do while loops
 
 >>Execute the body at least once before a test condition.
 format
        
        do {
        
          counter++;
          
        }while(counter <=10);
 
 
 ###Math Class Methods
 
 >>Methods in math class
>>Math.pow - power of a number eg pow(5,3) 5^3
>>Math.abs(-21.9) - absolute value;haow far from zero
 >>Math.ceil - Rounds up a number eg 7.4 =8.0 
 >>Math.floor - rounds down
 >>Math.max -two numbers and returns the maximum
 >> Math.min  -minimum of the two
 >>Math.sqrt - square root of a number
 
 ###Random Number Generator

>>import java.util.Random
 
 ###Introduction to Arrays
 >>a variable that can store a banch of related data types
 >>store values of the same data type
 
 ###Creating an Array Table
  
  >>Array has an idex and the corresponding value that is stored
 
 ###Summing Elements of Arrays
 
 >>Summing the elements of the array using a for loop
 
 ###Array Elements as Counters
 
 >>Take array elements and store them as counters.
 
 ###Enhanced for Loops
 
 >>Only takes two parameters; Variable that takes the value of the array as on loops through the array.
 >>The second parameter is the name of the array, to specify the array that is being talked about.
 
 ###Multidimensional Arrays
 
 >>Used when one want to make a table or something that require coordinates. Two square brackets; one for rows and the other one for columns.
 
 ###Table for Multiple Arrays
 
 >>Creating a table using the multi-dimensional array. This is done using two for loops.
 
 ###Variable Length Arguments
 
 >>Method without knowing how many arguments it takes MethodName(int...nameofthevariable)
 >>the dots means you dont know how many arguments it takes
 
 ###Time Class
 
 >> time class has a bunch of different time functions and can convert it into military or regular time
 

 
 ###Public, Private, and this
 
 >>used to control access of variables.
 >>Private can be accessed in th class in which it is defined.
 >>Visible to all the classes in the same program.
 
 ###Building Objects for Constructors.
 >>Constructor is a  with the same name as the class.
 >>Can build multiple constructors depending on the number of arguments.
