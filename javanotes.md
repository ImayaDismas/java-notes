 ###Use Method with Parameters
 
 >>An augument is any extra parameter data or information required by the function for it to work.
 
 >>import java.util.Scanner is used to enable one to input data in java.
 
 >>nextLine() used when scanning a string or word.
 
 ###Many Methods and Instances
 
 >>Private variable only the methods in the class can use it
 >>Public variable any class can use (access anywhere).
 
 #####setters
 
 >>sets any input given into a variable specified as private at declaration
  
 #####getters
 
 >>returns the value that was stored in the private variable
 
 >>System.ut.printf - use %s to fetch a stored variable.
 
 ###Constructors
 
 >>Allows one to initalize a variable as soon as you create an object.
 >>Costructor name has the same name as the class name.
 
 >>Objects enable one to pass a different set of variables.(same constructor but several objects)
 
 
###Nested If Statements and If else 

>>Provides Java with a way of making one choice or many choices
>>Nested If statement has an embedded if else statement.
 
 
 ###Else If Statement
 
 >>Enables java to have an alternative options apart from the first one

 ###Conditional Operator
 
 >>is another way of implementing an else if statement

 ###Simple Avearging Program
 
 >>Input 10n numbers and calculate the average.
 >>use while loop to scan the 10 numbers.
 
 ###for loops
 
 >>takes three statement/ keyword *where to start, end and an increment by?*
 >> for instance if the end is 10, the loop will execute 11 times
 
 ###Compound Interest
 
 >>A=P(1+r)^n
 >>Use a for loop to loop through the years.
